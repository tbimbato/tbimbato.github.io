        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I am a Data Science student with a background in architecture, currently pursuing a Master's degree at Uppsala University, Sweden. My academic journey spans machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analysis, with hands-on experience in Python programming and neural network implementation.</p>
        <p>Prior to my transition into data science, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Architecture at IUAV University of Venice, which developed my analytical thinking and project management skills. This interdisciplinary background allows me to approach data problems with both technical rigor and creative problem-solving.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, gardening, and experimenting with sound design.</p>

        <h2>Projects & Recognitions</h2>

        <p>| 2025 <strong>Diabetes Predictor</strong> — Developed a dashboard for predicting and comparing benchmarks of different machine learning methods for diabetes prediction based on patient blood test features and analysis.  
        | <a href="https://github.com/tbimbato" target="_blank">[WIP - Private Repo]</a></p>
        
        <p>| 2018 — Mentioned in IQD n. 53 (Singolarità) and cited in "Lampedusa: La Cattedrale di Solomon - Vol. II" as student-contributor to a project with Arch. Renato Rizzi.</p>

        <p>| 2015 — Co-designed and presented ‘Nothing Personal’, working in a team of six on the exhibition layout and immersive audiovisual experience at IUAV’s ‘Ex Cotonificio’ main exhibition area. The exhibition was extended beyond its initial timeframe due to public and academic interest.</p>


        <h2>Current Working On</h2>

        <p>|2025 <strong>Statistical Learning: An Informal Overview</strong> — A comprehensive collection of notes and insights on statistical learning methods from a theoretical perspective, explained in an informal and intuitive manner. This resource aims to help students approach these complex topics rigorously without relying on overly dense academic texts, providing clear understanding through accessible explanations.  
        | <a href="https://github.com/tbimbato" target="_blank">[WIP - Private Repo]</a></p>

    <p>|2025 <strong>AI and Music: A Technical and Epistemological Approach</strong> — Writing a research paper exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and music composition, examining how AI systems can interpret mathematical structures in Western music while addressing the role of rule-breaking in human creativity and subjective aesthetic judgment.  
    | <a href="https://github.com/tbimbato" target="_blank">[WIP - Private Repo]</a></p>


        <p>|2024 <strong>Neural Network Deployment on PYNQ FPGA Board</strong> — Implementing and optimizing neural network models for hardware acceleration on Xilinx PYNQ FPGA.
